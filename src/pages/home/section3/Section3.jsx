    text: `I have worked with Robert on numerous occasions, and I hope I will be able to work with him in the future too. Robert is an extremely talented designer, with an eye for modern UI, but keeping things very balanced, without overdoing the current trends. He seems to be a step ahead of the trends and to create timeless designs at the same time. He did a wonderful job working with us when developing the Plum Village App. You can google it and install it on your phone if you want to see Robert's designs in action. Much recommended!`,
